# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## What You Can Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about:

- **Technology**: My experiences with web development, programming, and new technologies
- **Photography**: Tips, techniques, and stories behind my photos
- **Life**: Personal reflections and experiences

## Getting Started

This blog is built with Next.js and uses MDX for content. You can create new posts by adding `.mdx` files to the `data/blog/` directory.

### Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write in Markdown with MDX components
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- **Responsive Design**: Works great on all devices
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic dark/light mode switching

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy the content!

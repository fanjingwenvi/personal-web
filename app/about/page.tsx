          Daymoon comes from those rare moments when you see the moon shining in the daytime â€” simple, quiet, and a little magical. This is where I put the thoughts I&apos;m exploring, the things I&apos;m working on, and the moments I would like to remember. I hope that in sharing them, I can grow a little myself, and it may be helpful to others.
